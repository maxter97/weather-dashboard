# Building a Weather Data Collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API
Project 1 for DevOp Challenge #DevOpsAllStarsChallenge
# Overview
This project grabs real-time weather data for multiple cities. It displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions. Then it automatically stores weather data in an AWS S3 bucket.

# Prerequisites
1. Familiar with AWS and Python
2. AWS Account: To use S3 and install <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> 
3. API Key from OpenWeather: Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up to obtain a free tier API key.
4. A Code/Text Editor: To edit any code if needed
5. IDE (ex. VS Code)
# Instructions

1. Clone Repository using the command  
    
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/maxter97/weather-dashboard.git
```
2. Move to where the weather-dashboard directory is stored. Then install all dependencies needed for this project using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
* If the command does not work try to using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a> command or use the <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/">pipx<a/> command to creating a virtual environments to install your dependencies.

3. Add your credentials needed to access AWS resources using
```bash
aws Configue
```
* For best practice, create an IAM user with short-term credentials using IAM Identity Center. If done this way make sure to still add credentials to ~/.aws/credentials or use export command to add them. Use this command if done this way.
```bash
aws configure sso
``` 
  
4. Create a a .env file and put your OpenWeather API key and bucket name into it (If you do not have a bucket name entered the code will create a new s3 bucket named weather-dashboard- with a random 4 digit number at the end)

5. Run (Python command vary depending on version and OS)
   Update: You can now enter the cites you want to collect data on.
```bash
python3 weather_dashboard.py script 
```

6. Now Your data should be in your newly created S3 Bucket

# Future Enhancements
1. Input different cite
2. Be able to create a weather dashboard with data
3. Automate and run in a virtul environment
